      Today, the finale of Invincible Season 3 dropped and I wanted to talk about it quickly. If you have watched invincible and have been watching season 3
  as it's been releasing then you know that this season has been nothing short of amazing. It has been leading all the way up to the climatic battle between  
   Mark and Conquest. As someone who read the comic and knew what was going to happen, I was still so excited for this episode and it did not dissapoint. 
  The fight was absolutely incredible and the animation was top-notch. Earlier today, it was at a 10/10 on IMDB making it the highest rated animated episode of all time. 
  It has since then dropped to a 9.9. I highly recommend watching this show as it is probably one of, if not the best animated superhero show of all time.
