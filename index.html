    <h3><i>Hello, my name is Zach, and I am a student at CSI studying Information Systems. I am currently in my third year and the spring semester. 
        This website will be used for future labs and assignments.</i></h3>

    <p>
        Some hobbies that I have include playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows and hanging out with friends. 
        By far one of my favorite TV shows is Dexter. It is a show about Dexter, a serial killer who only kills other killers. 
        He works a day job as a forensics technician. Even though the show aired all the way back in 2006, it still has a big fanbase and a 
        prequel to it just finished airing followed by a sequel coming out this summer.

        I also have a dog. He is a golden doodle named Milo and he is 4.
