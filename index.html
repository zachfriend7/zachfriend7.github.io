    <h3><i>Hello, my name is Zach, and I am a student at CSI studying Information Systems. I am currently in my third year and the spring semester.

    <p>
        Some hobbies that I have include playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows and hanging out with friends. 
         By far one of my favorite TV shows is Dexter. It is a show about Dexter, a serial killer who only kills other killers. Even though the show aired all the way back in 2006, it still ha s abig fanbase and a prequel to it just finished airing followed by a sequel coming out this summer.
