    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Zach, and I am a student at CSI studying Information Systems. I am currently in my third year and the spring semester. 
        This website will be used for future labs and assignments.  </p>

     <p>
        Some hobbies that I have include playing videogames, watching movies/TV shows and hanging out with friends. By far one of my favorite TV shows is Dexter.

     </p>

    <p>
       I also have a dog. He is a golden doodle named Milo and he is 4.
